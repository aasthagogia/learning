			Q: `WHAT IS THE ENOSI ROADMAP?`,
			ans: `<p>Enosi plans to open source V1.0 in Q3 2018. V1.0 will be open to the growing list of Enosi partners, including foundation partner Solar Analytics (a peer-to-peer solar service for 18,000+ customers and households across Australia).</p>
				<p>Enosi will then expand interstate and globally, with other state-based energy grids, working with partners to adapt the software for individual markets.</p>
				<p>The Enosi Foundation will leverage dozens of local development teams across the globe.</p>`
		},
		{
			Q: `WHAT IS GRID 2.0?`,
			ans: `<p>Grid 2.0 is an intelligent set of integrated microgrids which can cost effectively transport energy.</p>
				<p>Broad adoption of new smart home energy management systems able to adjust consumption to bene t from times when electricity is available in abundance with a set of connected energy storagetechnologies consisting of both a broad base of electric vehicles and new battery technologies.</p>
				<p>Grid 2.0 is the path to providing low cost, clean and reliable electricity globally to all.</p>`
		},
		{
			Q: `WHY IS THE PLATFORM BEING BUILT ONETHEREUM?`,
			ans: `<p>Ethereum’s underlying technology has proven to be secure</p>
				<p>The previous vulneabilities of smart contracts were a result of poor coding.</p>
				<p>Ethereum has a large community of developers, intact, the largest number of transactions of any blockchain and it has an established system of building and deploying smart contracts.</p>
				<p>While scalability could be an issue, Ethereum has ve major projects on the horizon that will signifcantly increase transactions per second. These include; Truebit, <em>Raiden, Plasma, Proof of Stake and Sharding.</em></p>
				<p>Enosi believes these technologies, when deployed, will enhance scailibity issues.</p>`

			Q: `ONCE THE PLATFORM IS LIVE, HOW CAN INNOVATIVE ELECTRICITY RETAILERS JOIN THE ENOSI NETWORK?`,
			ans: `<p>In the early years of operation the Enosi Foundation intends to directly support retail partners. As we
						expand, the process of establishing an EDAO will also be automated.</p>`
		},
		{
			Q: `ONCE THE PLATFORM IS LIVE, HOW WILL CONSUMERS JOIN THE ENOSI NETWORK?`,
			ans: `<p>Consumers will join using mobile or web applications provided by neo-retailers. In the early years of operation Enosi will support neoretailers by providing dApps and directing potential customers to the available energy communities.</p>`
		},
		{
			Q: `HOW IS THE ENOSI FOUNDATION A NOT-FORPROFIT ENTITY?`,
			ans: `<p>Enosi will only collect a small proportion of JOULs staked, sufficient to fund its ongoing support operations as a global foundation. The foundation will ultimately be focused on supporting a global network of open source developers.</p>`
		},
		{
			Q: `WILL THERE BE A TOKEN GENERATION EVENT?`,
			ans: `<p>Yes. Planning for a Token Generation Event is underway. Message Enosi via telegram to express your interest.</p>`
		},
		{
			Q: `HOW IS ENOSI DIFFERENT FROM POWERLEDGER?`,
			ans: `<p>Enosi is an open source project that can be integrated into existing regulatory grids. The software can be adapted for a variety of regulated environments or can be used to established a microgrid.</p>
			<p>Each community of producers and consumers represent a DAO.</p>
			<p>Each DAO manages wholesale energy procurement, risk management, energy metering and billing and reconciliation.</p>
			<p>Enosi’s ultimate aim is to replace the energy ‘middle-men’.</p>
			<p>The Powerledger project is not open source, instead it creates microgrids with existing middle-men (such as Origin Energy).</p>
			<p>Although microgrids have a role to play, Enosi believes the biggest change the energy sector is going to come by distrupting existing regulated power grids.</p>`
